# zkSync CLI tool

This CLI tool simplifies the process of developing applications and interacting with zkSync 2.0.

## Requirements

- Node/NPM
- Yarn

## Usage

You can install this program globally with `npm i -g zksync-cli` or run the commands direcly with npx with `npx zksync-cli@latest {COMMAND}`.

### Commands

- `zksync-cli create {PROJECT_NAME}`: creates a new Hardhat project in the given project name. If not provided, creates the project in the current folder, although this requires the folder to be empty.

- `zksync-cli deposit`: deposits funds from L1 (Goerli testnet) to zkSync 2.0 testnet. It will ask to enter: recipient wallet, amount in ETH (eg 0.1) and the private key of the wallet you're sending the funds from.

- `zksync-cli withdraw`: withdraws funds from zkSync 2.0 to L1 (Goerli testnet). It will ask to enter: recipient wallet, amount in ETH (eg 0.1) and the private key of the wallet you're sending the funds from.

> Both deposit and withdraw might take a couple of minutes to complete.

## Developing new features
